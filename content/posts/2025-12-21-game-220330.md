Snapbreak Games has officially announced the release date for the mobile version of their atmospheric puzzle game, Silt, set to launch on iOS and Android on January 20, 2026. This underwater adventure combines elements of horror and puzzle-solving, inviting players to dive into a dark, flooded world filled with hostile creatures and eerie mysteries.

In Silt, players take on the role of a diver who can temporarily inhabit marine life, using their unique abilities to navigate through challenging puzzles and explore ancient ruins hidden beneath the ocean's surface. The games hand-drawn monochrome visuals create a haunting atmosphere reminiscent of indie classics like Limbo and Inside, which have captivated audiences since their release.

The mobile adaptation is designed for touch controls, allowing for an intuitive gaming experience. At launch, players will have the opportunity to try out a demo version before making a one-time purchase to unlock the full game. With a solid 77% positive review rating on Steam, Silt has already garnered attention, and its upcoming mobile release is sure to attract even more fans. Will you be ready to face the depths when Silt arrives on your mobile device?
