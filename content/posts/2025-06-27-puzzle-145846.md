Capcom's upcoming title, Pragmata, is set to redefine the gaming landscape with its innovative puzzle-shooting mechanics. In a recent gameplay reveal, players were introduced to a unique blend of hacking and combat, where they must solve puzzles to disable robots while simultaneously engaging in intense shooting sequences. This dual-layered gameplay promises to offer a fresh experience that challenges both the mind and reflexes.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, players will step into the shoes of Hugh, a skilled spaceman, alongside his enigmatic android companion, Diana. The narrative and setting are rich with potential, especially given Capcom's pedigree in crafting immersive worlds. Despite its delays since the initial announcement in June 2020, the anticipation surrounding Pragmata continues to grow, especially after positive impressions from recent media previews.

As we look forward to its release in 2026, one can't help but wonder how Capcom will expand on these intriguing concepts over the course of what is expected to be a lengthy gameplay experience. Will Pragmata set a new standard for puzzle-shooters in the industry? Only time will tell.
