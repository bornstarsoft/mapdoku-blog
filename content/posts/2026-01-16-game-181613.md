In a significant announcement, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO title, New World: Aeternum, will permanently go offline on January 31, 2027. The game has already been removed from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, marking the end of an era for its dedicated player base. This decision comes as part of Amazon's shift away from MMO development, leaving fans with just one year to enjoy the game before it disappears completely.

Players who have previously purchased New World will still be able to download and install the game, but they will no longer have access to its features after the shutdown date. The Nighthaven season will be extended until the servers close, providing one last opportunity for players to engage with the game and its community. Amazon expressed gratitude towards its players, acknowledging the shared journey and the special moments created within the world of Aeternum.

As we look ahead, the closure of New World raises questions about the future of MMO gaming and the evolving landscape of online multiplayer experiences. What will this mean for the community and the genre as a whole? Only time will tell.
