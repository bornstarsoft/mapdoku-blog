The turn-based RPG genre, once a titan in the gaming world, faces an uphill battle against lingering prejudice, as highlighted by Guillaume Broche, the creative director of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Despite the game's impressive success, Broche notes that the genre has been deemed "uncool" since the rise of open-world games, leading to a perception that still hampers its popularity today.

Broche's insights reveal a fascinating dichotomy: while titles like Persona continue to thrive, the broader landscape remains skeptical of turn-based mechanics. This sentiment is echoed in the design choices of Clair Obscur, where features like parrying and dodging were not implemented to appease critics but to enhance gameplay. This commitment to creative vision over market trends is a refreshing take in an industry often driven by consumer expectations.

As we look ahead, the question remains: can turn-based RPGs reclaim their former glory in a gaming world that increasingly favors fast-paced action? With innovative titles and dedicated teams like Sandfall Interactive, the future may hold surprising developments for this beloved genre.
