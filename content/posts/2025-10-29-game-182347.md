GOG's recent addition of 16 classic PC games to its Preservation Program highlights a significant commitment to keeping gaming history alive. Among the newly added titles are iconic games like the original *Hitman: Codename 47* and *Tom Clancys Splinter Cell*, ensuring that players can experience these classics on modern hardware without the hassle of compatibility issues.

The Preservation Program aims to provide a solution for gamers who cherish the nostalgia of early titles while also catering to new players eager to explore the roots of beloved franchises. With the total number of titles in the program now reaching 216, GOG is on a mission to preserve gaming history, one title at a time. This initiative not only showcases the importance of classic games but also emphasizes the demand for authentic gaming experiences.

As GOG continues to expand its catalog, one can't help but wonder: will we see even more beloved classics revived in the future? The journey of preserving gaming history is just beginning, and it promises to be an exciting ride for both old and new gamers alike.
