Double Fine Productions has unveiled Kiln, an innovative online multiplayer pottery party brawler that allows players to unleash their creativity while engaging in fun, competitive gameplay. Players take on the role of a small spirit who must craft their own armor from clay using a pottery wheel, giving them complete control over the design and functionality of their creations.

The game offers a unique twist on traditional brawlers, allowing players to sculpt their armor into various shapes and sizes, from plates to jugs, and even dynamic weapons like pies and dynamite. With a plethora of customization options, including toppers and glazes, Kiln promises to deliver a vibrant and engaging experience that encourages creativity and strategic gameplay.

As players dive into Quench mode, featuring 4v4 online battles, they can expect a variety of maps, each with its own gameplay hooks. The team at Double Fine aims to prioritize community feedback post-launch, ensuring that Kiln evolves based on player preferences. With its release on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC later this year, the anticipation is building. Will Kiln redefine the multiplayer brawler genre?
