In a significant turn of events, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending closure due to unsuccessful attempts to secure a new partner for its project, Midnight Riders. The studio, which was established in 2023 by former Ubisoft Toronto staff, will cease operations on November 17th, 2025, marking a notable moment in the gaming industry as it reflects broader trends of consolidation and partnership challenges.

This closure is particularly striking as it follows the recent news of another NetEase subsidiary, Fantastic Pixel Castle, also shutting down on the same date. As NetEase reportedly scales back its overseas operations, the fate of the Midnight Riders project remains uncertain, although the studio is open to acquisition or partnership discussions. This situation raises questions about the sustainability of smaller studios in a competitive market dominated by larger players.

As we look ahead, the gaming landscape continues to evolve, and it will be interesting to see how other studios respond to these challenges. Will we witness a shift in how partnerships are formed in the industry?
