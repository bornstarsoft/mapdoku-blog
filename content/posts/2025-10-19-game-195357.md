After two decades of anticipation, the legendary Infinity on Game Boy Color is finally set to release in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software, showcases a unique strategic battle system and an engaging plot that has captivated retro gaming enthusiasts for years. With its rich history and the recent revival efforts by Incube8 Games, Infinity promises to be one of the most significant releases for the Game Boy Color in recent memory.

Originally canceled in 2002 due to market challenges, Infinity resurfaced as a free ROM in 2016, reigniting interest among fans. The successful crowdfunding campaign in 2021 paved the way for its full revival, allowing players to explore a detailed world filled with over 30 areas, five playable characters, and more than 100 items. As we approach the release date, the excitement continues to build, making it a must-have for both collectors and gamers alike.

With pre-orders now available for various editions, including a collectors version packed with exclusive goodies, Infinity is poised to make a significant impact this holiday season. Will this revival of a once-abandoned gem redefine retro gaming for a new generation? Only time will tell.
