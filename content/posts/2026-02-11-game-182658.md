Apple has exciting news for gamers as it announces the launch of four new titles on Apple Arcade this March, with the highlight being "Oceanhorn 3: Legend of the Shadow Sea." Set to release on March 5, 2026, this action-RPG-adventure game invites players to explore a stunning 3D world nearly a thousand years after its predecessor, Oceanhorn 2. Fans can look forward to battling titans and uncovering secrets in a beautifully crafted universe, playable across multiple Apple devices including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro.

In addition to Oceanhorn 3, Apple Arcade will also introduce "Pocket Love!+", a charming life simulator where players can create their dream home with their partner and pet. Other titles include the puzzle game "Flow Free+" and the shop management game "Doraemon Dorayaki Shop Story+", both of which promise to deliver engaging gameplay experiences on iPhone and iPad.

With Apple Arcade's subscription model providing access to hundreds of games for just $6.99 a month, this new lineup is sure to attract both loyal fans and newcomers alike. As we gear up for the release, one can't help but wonder: what other surprises does Apple have in store for gamers this year?
