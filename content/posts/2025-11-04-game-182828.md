As the gaming community eagerly anticipates the results of the 43rd annual Golden Joystick Awards, two standout titles from Nintendo's Switch 2 lineup have garnered significant nominations: *Mario Kart World* and *Donkey Kong Bananza*. Both games are not only competing for the prestigious title of 'Console Game of the Year' but also for accolades in best multiplayer and best audio design categories, respectively. This recognition highlights the strong start for the Switch 2, which has quickly established itself in a competitive gaming landscape.

The nominations place *Mario Kart World* alongside heavyweights like *Death Stranding 2* and *Ghost of Ytei*, while *Donkey Kong Bananza* is also in the mix for best audio design. With public voting now open until the end of the month, fans have the chance to support their favorite titles. As we await the announcement of the winners on November 20, one can't help but wonder how these games will shape the future of Nintendo's offerings and the gaming industry as a whole.
