In an intriguing turn of events, Walmart may have inadvertently revealed two upcoming GameCube classics for the Nintendo Switch Online service: Metroid Prime 2 and Pikmin 2. This leak, spotted by vigilant social media users, raises questions about whether it was a simple error or an early glimpse at Nintendo's plans. While the retailer has not officially confirmed these titles, their presence on Walmart's website suggests that fans could soon enjoy these beloved games on their Switch consoles.

Currently, Nintendo has only announced three other GameCube titles for the service: Super Mario Sunshine, Pokmon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Pokmon Colosseum, with no release dates provided. The excitement surrounding the potential addition of Metroid Prime 2 is particularly noteworthy, especially considering the series producer's recent comments about wanting more players to experience its multiplayer mode.

As the gaming community eagerly anticipates official confirmation from Nintendo, one can't help but wonder: what other surprises might be in store for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers? Will this leak lead to a wave of nostalgia for classic GameCube titles?
