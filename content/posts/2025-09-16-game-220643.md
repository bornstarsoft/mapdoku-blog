As Battlefield 6 gears up for its October 10 launch, developers have made it clear that the game is designed with a "console-first" mentality. Technical Director Christian Buhl emphasized that the game was built from the ground up to provide a top-notch experience for console players, a shift from the franchise's historical roots as a PC-centric title. This approach not only enhances the gameplay for console users but also optimizes performance across all platforms, including PC.

In a recent interview, Senior Console Combat Designer Matthew Nickerson humorously referred to this development philosophy as "secretly console first," highlighting the team's commitment to ensuring that console players feel prioritized. Additionally, players will have the option to disable cross-play with PC, addressing concerns about competitive fairness and cheating. This means that console players can enjoy a tailored matchmaking experience, primarily connecting with fellow console gamers.

With the ongoing testing of the Battle Royale mode on the Battlefield Labs platform, fans are eagerly anticipating how these changes will impact gameplay. Will this focus on console gaming redefine the Battlefield experience for a new generation of players? Only time will tell.
