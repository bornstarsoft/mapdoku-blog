If you're a fan of indie horror games, now is the perfect time to grab a copy of Haus Of Irndrous for free on Steam! Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric horror puzzle game is currently available at no cost until July 19, 2025, after which it will transition to a paid model priced at $1.99. This unique opportunity allows players to experience the first chapter of the game without any financial commitment, making it an enticing offer for horror enthusiasts.

Originally launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous was designed to be an episodic experience, with the first chapter intended to remain free while subsequent episodes would be paid. However, Yxtopia Studios has decided to implement a price tag earlier than expected, citing the need for funding future chapters and supporting auxiliary servers as key reasons for this shift. As the game evolves, player feedback will be crucial in shaping its development, so now is the time to jump in and make your voice heard.

With the recent update 17.0 introducing significant improvements, including enemy AI enhancements and performance optimizations, there's never been a better time to explore the eerie world of Haus Of Irndrous. Will you take advantage of this limited-time offer and dive into the chilling puzzles that await? Don't miss out on this opportunity to claim your copy before it becomes a paid title!
