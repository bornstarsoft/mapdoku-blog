In an unexpected twist, Assassin's Creed Shadows has emerged as the best-selling console game of 2025, excluding sports titles and shooters like Battlefield 6. Despite facing significant criticism online, this latest installment in the beloved franchise has resonated with gamers, proving that sales success can sometimes defy public perception.

Analysts from Newzoo recently released a report highlighting the top-selling console games, where established franchises dominated the charts. While Electronic Arts' sports games and other popular titles like Borderlands and Pokemon were expected contenders, Assassin's Creed Shadows managed to carve out a notable position, showcasing the enduring appeal of the Assassin's Creed brand.

This development raises intriguing questions about the gaming industry's dynamics. Can a game thrive in sales despite mixed reviews? As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see how Ubisoft continues to evolve the Assassin's Creed franchise and whether it can maintain this momentum in future releases.
