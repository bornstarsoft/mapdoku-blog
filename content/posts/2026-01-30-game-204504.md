According to the latest GDC survey, a striking trend has emerged: developers are twice as likely to express interest in creating games for the PS5 or Switch 2 compared to the Xbox Series X/S. This survey, which gathered insights from over 2,300 industry professionals, highlights a significant shift in preferences, with only 20% of respondents indicating a desire to develop for Xbox, in stark contrast to 40% for PS5 and 39% for Switch 2.

The findings suggest a growing disinterest in Xbox among developers, despite the platform's previous popularity. Interestingly, while 40% of respondents reported their last project was released on Xbox, it seems that the allure of developing for Sony's consoles is stronger than ever. Factors such as audience reach and business model success are driving these choices, indicating that developers are keenly aware of market dynamics.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be fascinating to see how these preferences shape future game releases. Will Xbox find a way to regain developer interest, or will the trend towards PS5 and Switch 2 continue to dominate?
