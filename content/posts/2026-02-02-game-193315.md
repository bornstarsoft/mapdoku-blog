In a significant move for the gaming community, Respawn Entertainment has announced that the Nintendo Switch version of Apex Legends will be shutting down this summer. This decision marks the end of an era for players who have enjoyed the battle royale experience on the handheld console since its launch in 2021. Starting August 4, 2026, players will no longer be able to access the game on the Switch, and the final update will roll out with Season 29.

For those who have invested time and money into the game on Switch, there are important considerations to keep in mind. Players will need to either spend their remaining Apex Coins before the shutdown or upgrade to the upcoming Switch 2 version to retain their in-game currency. While items purchased on Switch will transfer to other platforms, the currency will remain exclusive to Nintendo consoles, making this transition crucial for avid players.

As we look ahead, the transition to the Switch 2 promises an enhanced gaming experience, thanks to Nintendo's investment in the new hardware. This change not only reflects the evolving landscape of gaming but also highlights the importance of adapting to new technologies. Will you be making the switch to the new console, or will you explore other platforms for your Apex Legends fix?
