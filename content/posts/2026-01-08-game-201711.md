The newly launched visual puzzle game AiliA, developed by IceToad Studio LLC, is making waves on Steam with its unique mirror-based gameplay mechanics. Priced at $11.99, players can enjoy a 20% discount during the launch period, making it an enticing option for puzzle enthusiasts. AiliA invites players to step into the shoes of Aria, a young girl navigating through a beautifully crafted world that blurs the lines between reality and reflection.

What sets AiliA apart is its innovative use of mirrors, which are not just visual elements but interactive spaces that players can manipulate to solve over 100 puzzles across seven themed areas. The game challenges players with intricate puzzles that utilize water reflections and recursive mirror structures, alongside thrilling boss encounters that incorporate these mechanics. With a free demo available, players can dive into this captivating experience and uncover the story woven into the memories of the sisters Aria and Lia.

As the gaming community embraces this fresh take on puzzle-solving, one can't help but wonder: how will AiliA influence the future of puzzle games? Will we see more titles exploring the interplay of reflection and reality?
