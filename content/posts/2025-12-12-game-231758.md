Larian Studios has officially announced a new entry in the beloved Divinity series, confirming that the mysterious statue unveiled during The Game Awards was indeed a teaser for this upcoming title. Simply referred to as "Divinity" for now, this game promises to expand on the rich lore and gameplay mechanics that fans have come to love, with a description hinting at a darker narrative: "The gods are silent. Rivellon bleeds. New powers stir."

The excitement surrounding this announcement is palpable, especially given Larian's recent success with Baldur's Gate 3, which won multiple awards, including Game of the Year. With a history of delivering immersive RPG experiences, Larian aims to push the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay in this new installment. The studio's commitment to developing its own IPs marks an exciting new chapter for both the developers and fans alike.

As we await more details, one can't help but wonder how this new Divinity game will evolve the franchise and what fresh challenges and adventures await us in Rivellon. Are you ready to dive back into this enchanting world?
