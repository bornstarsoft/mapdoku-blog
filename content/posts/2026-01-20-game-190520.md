Japan's console game market experienced an astonishing growth of 138.8% in 2025, reaching a staggering 418.13 billion yen (approximately $2.64 billion USD). This remarkable surge is primarily attributed to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which alone sold nearly 3.8 million units in Japan by the year's end. The data, reported by Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu, highlights a significant increase in both hardware and physical software sales, with hardware sales up by 149.3% and physical software sales growing by 121.0% compared to the previous year.

The best-selling titles, such as Mario Kart World and Pokmon Legends: Z-A, further underscore the impact of the Nintendo Switch 2 on the market. With anticipated releases like Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Resident Evil Requiem set for 2026, the future looks bright for Nintendo and the Japanese gaming industry. Will this momentum continue as new titles and consoles are introduced?
