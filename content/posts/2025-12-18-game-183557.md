November 2025 marked a historic low for hardware sales and physical game spending in the US, with sales figures reflecting the worst performance since tracking began 30 years ago. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a staggering drop from previous years, driven largely by an all-time high average price of $439 per unit, which is 11% higher than last year.

The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, followed closely by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S. However, the overall spending on physical software also suffered, plummeting 14% compared to the previous year, indicating a significant shift in consumer purchasing behavior, likely favoring digital formats over physical copies.

As we move forward, the question remains: how will console manufacturers adapt to these market challenges, particularly with rising component costs and tariffs? The future of dedicated gaming devices may hinge on their ability to innovate and possibly lower prices in a tough economic landscape.
