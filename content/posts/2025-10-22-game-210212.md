Enigmo, the classic puzzle game originally launched in 2003, has been reimagined for the Samsung Galaxy XR, bringing a fresh spatial 3D experience to gamers. This timed exclusive allows players to manipulate their surroundings by placing puzzle pieces in their own rooms to guide lasers, plasma, and water to their respective destinations. With both hand tracking and controller support, the game immerses players in a unique interactive environment that challenges their problem-solving skills.

The game features a total of 50 base levels and introduces nine different puzzle pieces that players can use to navigate various mechanics, including laser beams and teleporters. As players progress, they will encounter increasingly complex challenges that require creative thinking and spatial awareness. Fortell Games has also announced plans for additional level packs, ensuring that the gameplay remains engaging and dynamic.

While currently exclusive to the Galaxy XR, Enigmo is set to expand its reach to Quest headsets in the future, although a release date has yet to be confirmed. As the world of gaming continues to evolve with advancements in technology, Enigmo stands out as a prime example of how classic games can be revitalized for new platforms. What other classic games do you think could benefit from a similar transformation into immersive experiences?
