Fans are buzzing with excitement as they believe Nintendo may have inadvertently revealed upcoming titles for the Nintendo Switch Online's N64 library. A recent trailer showcased blurred images of several classic games, leading to speculation that fan-favorites like Donkey Kong 64 and Super Smash Bros could soon be available for subscribers. 

This revelation comes as part of Nintendo's ongoing efforts to expand its classic games library, which already includes over 30 titles. The blurred artwork, initially thought to be placeholders, has sparked discussions among the community about what other beloved games might be joining the lineup. With the recent addition of GameCube titles to the service, the anticipation for more N64 classics is palpable. 

As Nintendo continues to innovate and engage its audience, the potential arrival of these iconic games could redefine the nostalgic gaming experience for many. What other titles do you hope to see added to the Nintendo Switch Online service in the future?
