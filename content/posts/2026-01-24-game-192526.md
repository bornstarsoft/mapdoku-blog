In a bold move, Game Freak has revealed that its upcoming action RPG, *Beast of Reincarnation*, will be developed with a relatively small internal team while outsourcing significant portions of the work to various partner studios. This strategy allows the Pokmon studio to maintain a central direction and management role while leveraging external expertise to realize its ambitious vision for the game.

The game, featuring an exiled protagonist named Emma and her wolf companion Koo, presents a unique world overrun by parasitic plants known as the blight. Emmas ability to hunt Malefacts and absorb their powers adds an intriguing gameplay dynamic. Game director Kota Furushima emphasized that while the internal team is small, the collaboration with external studios is crucial for the project's success.

As the gaming community eagerly anticipates the summer release on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, it raises an interesting question: will this outsourcing approach set a new standard for game development in the industry? Only time will tell how this strategy impacts the final product and the future of Game Freak's projects.
