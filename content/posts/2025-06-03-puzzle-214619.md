Whether you're into narrative-driven adventures, action-packed gameplay, or relaxing word games, there's something for everyone this month.

First on the list is **The Falling Star**, a captivating walking simulator that invites players to embark on a journey filled with introspective storytelling. You'll follow a girl as she uncovers the truth behind her family's past, all set against a beautifully crafted dreamscape. If action is more your style, **Sporeborne** delivers an exhilarating hack-and-slash experience where you play as a mutated fungus on a quest for power and survival.

For those looking to unwind, **Obgoose** offers a non-competitive twist on word games, perfect for fans of Scrabble and Wordle alike. Finally, **Gear Combination** challenges your strategic thinking with its engaging puzzle mechanics, where you combine gears to achieve target rotation speeds.
