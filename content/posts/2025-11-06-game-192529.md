Obsidian Entertainment has taken employee engagement to a whole new level by introducing a rewards system that mirrors the mechanics of role-playing games (RPGs). New employees at the studio choose a classwarrior, rogue, or wizardand embark on a journey of collecting themed gifts over their tenure, which can last up to 20 years. This innovative approach not only enhances employee retention but also fosters a sense of community and belonging among staff.

The rewards system, as explained by VP of Operations Marcus Morgan, includes milestone gifts that reflect the chosen class, such as D&D-style dice for warriors or cloaks for wizards. This fun and engaging method of recognizing employee loyalty is a testament to Obsidian's commitment to creating a workplace that feels like an adventure. By gamifying the employee experience, they are not only retaining talent but also nurturing a culture that values long-term commitment.

As companies look for creative ways to enhance employee satisfaction, Obsidian's RPG-inspired rewards scheme raises an intriguing question: could gamification be the key to building a more engaged workforce in other industries?
