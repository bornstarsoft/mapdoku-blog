Kojima Productions has taken a bold step into the gaming hardware arena with the announcement of its collaboration with ASUS Republic of Gamers (ROG) to launch the ROG Flow Z13-KJP gaming tablet. Designed by the iconic artist Yoji Shinkawa, known for his work on Death Stranding and Metal Gear, this tablet is not just a piece of technology but a piece of art that embodies the essence of the beloved Ludens mascot.

The ROG Flow Z13-KJP boasts impressive specifications, including a 13.4-inch 2.5K display with a stunning 180Hz refresh rate and powered by an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 processor. Accompanied by a custom-designed carry case, this tablet is set to appeal to both gamers and fans of Kojima Productions alike. Alongside the tablet, ASUS has also introduced a range of themed accessories, including a gaming headset and mouse, further enhancing the immersive gaming experience.

As we look forward to the official release, which is expected in the first half of this year, one can't help but wonder how this collaboration will influence the future of gaming hardware design. Will we see more studios stepping into the tech space?
