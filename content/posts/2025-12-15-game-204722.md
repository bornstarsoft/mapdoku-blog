Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, developed by Chris Oberth in 1991 but never released, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This exciting revival not only brings a piece of gaming history back to life but also highlights the importance of preserving our digital heritage. The polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, includes an authentic NES cart and a detailed manual that dives into the game's troubled past and Oberth's career.

The release of Xcavator is a testament to the dedication of organizations like the Video Game History Foundation, which works tirelessly to archive and preserve the stories behind our favorite games. As we look forward to the 2025 release, it raises an important question: how many more hidden gems from the past are waiting to be discovered and shared with a new generation of gamers?
