If youre a fan of both dogs and puzzle games, then Dogpile might just be your new favorite pastime. This innovative title from Studio Folly and Toot Games combines the classic Tetris-style gameplay with an adorable twist: youre stacking and merging various breeds of dogs to create the ultimate canine companion. While it may not be the most complex puzzle game out there, its engaging mechanics and charming aesthetic make it a delightful experience for players of all ages.

The gameplay revolves around dragging and dropping dogs onto a grid, merging two of the same breed to create larger dogs. This simple yet addictive premise is enhanced by roguelite elements that introduce challenges and rewards as players progress. Collecting bones and achieving milestones unlocks new dogs and upgrades, adding depth to the gameplay. However, players should be aware of some bugs that can disrupt the experience, such as crashes and audio issues. 

Despite these minor setbacks, Dogpile offers a relaxing mode for those who want to enjoy the joy of merging without the pressure of goals. Whether youre a casual gamer or a puzzle aficionado, Dogpile provides a unique blend of fun and strategy that keeps you coming back for more. Will you be able to create the biggest doggo in the park?
