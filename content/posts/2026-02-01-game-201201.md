In an exciting twist for gamers, the upcoming title "Blocks for Babies" on Steam ingeniously merges the fast-paced action of DOOM with the classic puzzle mechanics of Tetris. Developed by indie studio BunkSoft Interactive, this game aims to evoke nostalgia while offering a fresh gameplay experience. Players will find themselves shooting blocks with a shotgun, transforming the traditional falling-block puzzle into a chaotic yet delightful adventure.

"Blocks for Babies" starts off in a familiar Tetris mode, where players arrange falling blocks to clear lines. However, the gameplay takes a thrilling turn as players are armed with firearms to combat demonic tetrominoes in a retro 3D environment. This unique blend not only showcases the creativity of indie developers but also highlights a growing trend in the gaming industry where genres are being fused to create innovative experiences.

With a free demo already available on Steam, fans of both puzzle and FPS genres can get a taste of this unusual combination. As we look ahead to its planned release in 2026, one can't help but wonder: will this hybrid gameplay redefine how we view genre boundaries in gaming?
