On July 24, the chaotic delivery simulator CarGo! will launch on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, inviting players to dive into a world of frantic courier missions. With its vibrant, cartoonish graphics and fast-paced gameplay, CarGo! offers an exhilarating experience reminiscent of popular titles like Overcooked and Moving Out. Whether you're racing against the clock solo or teaming up with friends in local co-op mode, the game promises to deliver a fun-filled adventure.

Developed by Memory Leak Games and Cleversan Games, CarGo! has already made waves on PC, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch since its debut in November 2024. The games isometric perspective and responsive controls make it easy to pick up, yet challenging to master, ensuring that players will be engaged as they navigate the logistics chaos across the colorful Carchipelago. With support for up to four players, teamwork and communication are key to overcoming the time-limited challenges.

As we look forward to its release, CarGo! is shaping up to be a must-play title for fans of couch co-op games. Will you be ready to tackle the delivery chaos with your friends this July?
