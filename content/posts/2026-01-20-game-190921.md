Japan's console game market experienced a staggering growth of 138.8% in 2025, reaching approximately $2.64 billion USD. This remarkable surge is largely attributed to the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which sold nearly 3.8 million units by year-end. The report from Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu highlights that both hardware and physical software sales saw significant increases, with hardware sales alone up by 149.3% year-on-year.

The success of the Nintendo Switch 2 has not only revitalized the console gaming landscape in Japan but has also set the stage for future growth with anticipated titles like Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Resident Evil Requiem on the horizon. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it's exciting to consider how these developments will shape the market in the coming years. Will the Nintendo Switch 2 maintain its momentum, or will new contenders emerge?
