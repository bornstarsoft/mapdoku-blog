BitSummit 2025 is set to be a remarkable showcase of indie creativity, featuring an impressive lineup of 120 games from Japan and around the globe. Scheduled to take place from July 19 to July 21 at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto, this year's theme, "Summer of Yokai," pays homage to the enchanting supernatural creatures of Japanese folklore. As the event celebrates its 13th iteration, it promises to be a vibrant gathering for developers and gamers alike.

Founded in 2012 by the Japan Independent Games Aggregate (JIGA), BitSummit has evolved from a modest industry-focused event to Japan's premier indie games expo, attracting over 38,000 attendees last year. With the goal of promoting unique Japanese indie games to an international audience, the event has become a cornerstone for indie developers to showcase their innovative ideas and connect with fans.

As excitement builds for this year's event, it's clear that BitSummit continues to champion bold creativity and foster a sense of community among indie game enthusiasts. Will you be joining the celebration of indie games this summer?
