In an exciting development for retro gaming enthusiasts, Namco's last major arcade title, Rave Racer, is finally making its way to home consoles. Scheduled for release on February 26, this marks the first official home version of the game, following the successful home release of the original Ridge Racer last year. Retro specialist Hamster Corporation continues to breathe new life into classic arcade titles, and Rave Racer is the latest addition to their Arcade Archives series.

Originally launched in 1995, Rave Racer was a groundbreaking title that showcased Namco's System 22 hardware, allowing for stunning polygonal graphics and 3D texture mapping. The game featured four tracks, with two being brand new, and introduced improvements in handling and visuals that set it apart from its predecessors. While a home port was initially planned, it was ultimately scrapped, leading to the release of Rage Racer on the PS1 instead. With this new release, fans can finally experience the game as it was meant to be played.

Rave Racer will be available on multiple platforms, including Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PS4, offering various modes for players to enjoy. The Arcade Archives versions will include Original Mode, High Score Mode, and Caravan Mode, while the Arcade Archives 2 versions will add Time Attack Mode and Network Mode for online play. This release not only celebrates the legacy of the Ridge Racer series but also highlights the growing trend of reviving classic arcade experiences for modern audiences. Are you ready to hit the tracks once again?
