In a surprising turn of events, Enhance Games has announced that their puzzle game, Humanity, will be discontinuing its online services by March 2026. This decision comes after a significant decline in user engagement, particularly in the User Stages mode, which allowed players to create and share their own levels. Despite the community's impressive contribution of over 30,000 stages over the past two and a half years, it seems that the service has not sustained enough interest to justify its continuation.

Currently, players can still enjoy stages theyve created and saved locally, but the ability to share new content or play others creations has already been disabled. While the studio has not provided a specific reason for this decision, its likely that the costs associated with hosting these online features have outweighed the benefits. As the gaming landscape evolves, this raises questions about the sustainability of online services in single-player focused titles.

Are you among those who enjoyed the community-made stages in Humanity? Or do you think the shift away from online features is a necessary step for the game's future? Let us know your thoughts!
