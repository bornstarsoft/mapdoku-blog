The gaming community is buzzing with excitement and intrigue following the leak of a pre-release build for Sony Interactive Studios and Firewalk Studios' canceled game, Concord. This build, named FWChaos, reportedly dates back to November 14, 2023, a full nine months prior to the game's anticipated launch in August 2024. The authenticity of the build has been confirmed by VGC, raising questions about what this means for the future of the game and the studio's reputation.

Upon loading the game, players encounter a login screen that cannot be bypassed, but an included .ini file allows access to a developer menu. This menu leads to a Select Freegunner screen, although it appears to be incomplete, as no characters are available for selection. The build also showcases a partially developed Galactic Guide, which hints at the game's expansive universe, alongside a Crew section detailing 16 playable characters and their outfits. Other features, like a Job Board and Store, are still in their infancy, suggesting that much work was left to be done.

This leak not only provides a glimpse into the development process of Concord but also raises broader questions about game preservation and the impact of leaks on the gaming industry. As we look ahead, will this leak influence how developers approach transparency and community engagement? The gaming world is watching closely.
