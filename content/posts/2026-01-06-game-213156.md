Sony has recently patented an intriguing technology that could revolutionize the gaming experience on PlayStation: the AI-generated 'Ghost Player.' This innovative system allows players to summon an AI version of their character to either demonstrate solutions to challenging puzzles or complete sections of the game entirely. Imagine being stuck on a tricky level in your favorite game and having an AI guide you through it, enhancing your gameplay without the frustration of being stuck.

This concept builds on Sony's existing PS5 Game Help system, which offers players hints and guidance through in-game cards. However, the Ghost Player takes it a step further by utilizing AI trained on actual gameplay footage, providing a more dynamic and personalized assistance experience. While this technology is still in the patent phase, it raises exciting possibilities for the future of gaming, especially for those who find themselves frequently challenged by complex puzzles or combat scenarios.

As AI continues to evolve in the gaming industry, one can't help but wonder: will we soon see a future where AI not only assists but also enhances our gaming experiences in ways we never imagined?
