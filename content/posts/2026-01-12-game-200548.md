In a remarkable display of appreciation, Shift Up, the South Korean studio behind the acclaimed game Stellar Blade, has gifted its employees a staggering $3,400 bonus along with high-end Apple products, including AirPods Max and an Apple Watch. This generous gesture, aimed at recognizing the hard work of its 300 staff members, highlights a growing trend in the gaming industry where companies are investing in their talent as a means to foster loyalty and boost morale.
